In the "Browser" window on the left, right-click Servers and register a server
In the pop-up, name the server whatever you would like
go to the connection tab and enter the following:

host name: ls-ba928ae2be3585780cbed39c970c226b7e3cfdfd.cchbgru4fwbb.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com
port: 5432
username: dbmasteruser

once this is done, save and you should see the server load into the Browser
