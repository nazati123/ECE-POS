# ECE-POS-Front

This directory hosts the Angular app running the front end of the website.

## Components

Currently the two components are the order-form and dashboard components. More components will be created during Sprint 2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Note that the functionality depends on Spring Boot functioning, so ensure the Spring Boot is also running to see the order table populate.
